This is a collection of my homework assignments, labs, and projects from the Masters of Software Development Program at the University of Utah.

CS6010 used C++ language and I wrote my code in Xcode. This was a 5 week course and it started with a simple "Hello World." program and ended with a group project that involved building a video game using the SFML library.
