For this project, we'll build a simplified version of the TLS protocol. We'll stick fairly close to real TLS, but we'll leave out lots of options, simplify the message format, and rely on Java serialization to write and parse messages.

The “Creating and signing certificates” part of this assignment is its own assignment with an earlier due date. That's to make sure you get started and get past the first hurdle.

Creating and signing certificates
We'll use three RSA public/private key pairs in our system:

Certificate Authority (CA) — A key pair to sign and verify certificates for the client and server. This our “Key Corp” stand-in for a service like Versign or Let's Encrypt, but since we're inventing it, it's authoritative only to our client and server.
Server — Needs a certificate signed by the CA and corresponding private key. The server will use these to authenticate itself to the client while performing a handshake.
Client — Also needs a signed certificate and corresponding private key, because we will implement an authenticated-client variant of TLS.
We'll use OpenSSL to generate our public/private key pairs and certificates. A macOS installation includes OpenSSL as openssl, and the following instructions have been tested with that version. If you use the Homebrew version of openssl, things might be different.

Create a working directory
We're going to create a bunch of files, so create a fresh directory and cd into that directory. This will be our working directory.

Generate the RSA public/private key pair for the CA
In the working directory:
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout CAprivateKey.pem -out CAcertificate.pem -days 30 -nodes

Let's walk through this command:

req — make a new certificate
-x509 — in x509 format (the standard format)
-newkey — generate a new RSA keypair for this certificate
rsa:4096 — make it a 4096 bit RSA key
-keyout CAprivateKey.pem — write the private key to CAprivateKey.pem
-out CAcertificate.pem — write the certificate to CAcertificate.pem
-days 30 — this certificate expires 30 days from now
-nodes — don't encrypt the certificate/private key
This command will take a while to run, because it has to find big prime numbers and do the other number theory stuff to pick the RSA exponents. It will generate new files in the working directory.

Note for the 3 sets of keys we'll be making, the country name, state name, and organization name must be the same for all 3. For the CSR's (below), I'd suggest picking different common names for the client/server. If don't enter the fields correctly, the certificate creation/signing part below will fail and openSSL will tell you why.

Generate client/server keys and certificate signature requests (CSRs)
Next we'll pick the keys for the client and server and a request for the CA to sign.

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout serverPrivate.key -out server.csr

This command will produce the private key and the request for the CA to sign for the server. You'll need to use a similar command for the client with file names using client instead of server.

Setup CA for signing, sign CSRs
Download this CA config file Download this CA config fileas config.cnf in your working directory. The file specifies a bunch of information for the CA — almost all of which is overkill for us, but it seems to be necessary. The configuration file specifies files and directories that need to exist to sign the CSRs and produce client and server certificates.

mkdir certs newcerts
touch index.txt
echo 1000 > serial
The file index.txt is the "database" that lists all the certificates that have been issued by our CA. (Again, this is overkill for us, but it makes OpenSSL happy.) The serial file keeps track of the serial numbers assigned to those certificates, since that number needs to be unique per certificate issued.

At this point, we can fulfill a CSR request:

openssl ca -config config.cnf -cert CAcertificate.pem -keyfile CAprivateKey.pem -in server.csr -out CASignedServerCertificate.pem

That's for the server, and you'll need a similar command for the client (with different file names). This command will take the CA certificate, CA private key, and CSR and will produce a certificate signed by our CA. Note that pretty much the only field that you'll be prompted to enter that really matters is the "common name." The index.txt file ensures that the CA does NOT sign multiple certificates for the same common name, so make sure you pick different names for the client and server.

Double checking
Our certificate files should contain the server's or client's public key. To verify that each matches its private key, we can confirm that the modulus (the big N) is the same for a certificate and the private key. We can use openssl sa to do compare. Because N is huge, we run the output of openssl rsa through a hash function and compare the hashes.

For the client, check that reading the private key with

openssl rsa -in clientPrivate.key -noout -modulus | openssl sha256

and reading the certificate

openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in CASignedClientCertificate.pem | openssl sha256

produce the same hash. Check the server's private key and certificate with suitably adjusted commands.

Formats
OpenSSL produces PEM format private key files, which is a text-based format that is a pain to work with Java. The DER binay format is easier to work with. We can use OpenSSL to convert our PEM private keys to DER private keys:

openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -outform DER -in serverPrivate.key -out serverPrivateKey.der -nocrypt

Checkpoint
The checkpoint assignment covers file generation before this point.

Handshake
At this point, we have the CA, certificates, and associated keys generated: serverRSAPriv (in the server private-key file), serverRSAPub (in the server certificate file), clientRSAPriv (in the client private-key file), and clientRSAPub (in the client certificate file). Those are generated just once and used for every communication.

The server and client will also agree on Diffie-Hellman parameters g and N. On each new connection from client to server, the server and client will pick random secret keys to use with Diffie-Hellman, which we'll call serverDHPriv for the server and clientDHPriv for the client. The public keys can be derieved: serverDHPub = g^serverDHPriv mod N and clientDHPub = g^clientDHPriv mod N.

Finally, the client will pick a random nonce for each connection (in addition to its Diffie-Hellman private key). The nonce can be 32 bytes from a SecureRandom object.

The client and server will each authenticate each other using a simplified TLS handshake as follows:

Client: sends nonce
Server: sends the server certificate, serverDHPub, and a signed Diffie-Hellman public key as Enc(serverRSAPriv, serveDHPub)
Client: sends a client certificate, a Diffie-Hellman public key, and a signed Diffie-Hellman public key as Enc(clientRSAPriv, clientDHPub)
At this point, the client and server can each check that the received certificate is valid according to the CA that they both know. The client and server can also compute the shared Diffie-Hellman secret. Using that shared secret as the master key, the client and server can then compute 6 session keys via a HKDF: 2 each of encryption keys, MAC keys, and initialization vectors (IVs) for CBC.

Finish the handshake with two more messages:

Server: sends HMAC of all handshake messages so far using the server's MAC key.
Client: sends HMAC of all handshake messages so far (including the previous step) using the clients's MAC key.
At this point, the client and server have authenticated.

Key generation: HKDF
Diffie-Hellman gives us a shared secret key, but it might be too small or be otherwise unsuitable to use as keys for AES or MACs. We'll run it through a key derivation function (KDF) to turn it into a bunch of nice, random-looking keys. Specifically, we'll use HKDF, and the nonce is used to start the HMAC sequence as sketched by this pseudocode:

function hdkfExpand(input, tag): // tag is a string, but that's easily converted to byte[]
okm = HMAC(key = input,  data = tag concatenated with a byte with value 1)
return first 16 bytes of okm

function makeSecretKeys(clientNonce, sharedSecretFromDiffieHellman):
prk = HMAC(key = clientNonce, data = sharedSecretFromDiffieHellman)
serverEncrypt = hkdfExpand(prk, "server encrypt")
clientEncrypt = hkdfExpand(serverEncrypt, "client encrypt")
serverMAC = hkdfExpand(clientEncrypt, "server MAC")
clientMAC = hkdfExpand(serverMAC, "client MAC")
serverIV = hkdfExpand(clientMAC, "server IV")
clientIV = hkdfExpand(serverIV, "client IV")
So, each key is essentially the result of hashing one of the other keys and adding in an extra "tag" to make sure they can't accidentally be mistaken for one another. Use the HmacSHA256 HMAC function.

Note, that Java has special types for the various types of secret keys. For many keys, you'll probably want to use the SecretKeySpec class to make a SecretKey instance. The SecretKeySpec constructor takes bytes and turns it into a key for a given algorithm — which doesn't change the value of the key, but marks its intended use. For IVs, use the IvParameterSpec class, instead.

Message format
After the handshake, each message will use a format similar to the TLS record format, but we'll let Java take care of the specifics by making use of the ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream classes.

To send a message:

Compute the HMAC of the message using the appropriate MAC key
Use the cipher object to encrypt the message data concatenated with the MAC
Send/receive the resulting byte array using the ObjectOutputStream/ObjectIntputStream classes (it will include the array size, etc automatically). You'll want to use the readObject/writeObject methods.
For encryption, we'll use AES 128 in CBC mode. For MAC, we'll use HMAC using SHA-256 as our hash function.

Code and testing
Write 2 programs, a client a server. Consider organizing your code as a single Java project with multiple classes that have main() methods.

The server should open a plain TCP server socket and listen for connections. After it accepts a new connection as a socket one, it should handshake with the client and then send multiple (at least two) messages to the client. The handshake part is inherent, while the additional messages act as tests to make sure that things work properly.

The client should handshake and then receive the messages. It should then send a message back to the server to indicate that it received the messages and in a way that indicates that it received the right messages. This step checks that we can actually send messages in both directions.

Note that the client and server should both read the CA certificate as well as their own certificates and private keys. Neither should read the other host's certificate/keys from files. The parties need to send the certificates to each other as part of the handshake protocol, and they should never access each other's private keys.

Suggestions
Use the 2048-bit Diffie Hellman group (g and N) from RFC 3526Links to an external site..
Start by having the client and server be part of the same non-networking program with comments to track which parts perform client tasks and which perform server tasks. After all of the crypto stuff works without sockets, reorganize and add the networking part.
There will be lots of shared code between the client/server, so factor it out. For example, you may have classes with static methods related to Diffie-Hellman, key generation, handshake operations, and message encryption.
The following Java classes will be useful:

BigInteger for Diffie-Hellman
java.security.cert.CertificateFactory
java.security.cert.Certificate
java.security.SecureRandom
javax.crypto.Cipher with "RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding" and "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"
javax.crypto.Mac
javax.crypto.SecretKey
javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec with "RawBytes" and "AES"
javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec
java.security.spec.PKCS8EncodedKeySpec for loading secret keys
java.security.KeyFactory to convert an RSA private key spec to a key
ByteArrayOutputStream
ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream
This is not an exhaustive list, however.
