Olivia & Victor, Min Shan & Zhiyuan, Gaofei & JJ, and 3 more
For each presentation you review, include the following, which will be shared with the presenters (without your name attached to the feedback):
•	What was the major security vulnerability in the described system (e.g., buffer overflow, code injection, susceptibility to denial of service)?
•	What was (at least) one thing the presenters did well in their talk?
•	What is one way the presenters could improve their presentation?
•	Include any other comments you'd like to provide.

Olivia & Victor
-	Stack Buffer Underflow in SQLite
-	One strength was there was clear division of the topics between the two speakers. It made it easy to follow. Good job of introducing technical concepts in a simplified way.
-	One area for improvement would be to incorporate simple visual aids. 

Min Shan & Zhiyuan
-	Shellshock
-	They did a great job explaining the background of Shellshock, including the role of Bash in Unix-based systems and how environment variables are used.
-	One part that could’ve been better was slowing down when talking about the technical payloads or code.

Gaofei & JJ
-	Log4Shell
-	Great job explaining what Log4Shell is and why it was such a critical vulnerability.
-	One way to improve the presentation would be to visualize the attack chain more clearly, maybe using diagrams or simple visual aids.

Evan & Jose
-	Evan and Jose did a great job outlining the timeline of key events of the attack which gave an understanding of what happened and when.
-	One improvement I could suggest would be to slow down on the details of the SQL injection or simplify it in a way that can be remembered easier.

Owen & Ben
-	Stuxnet
-	Excellent job capturing the complexity and intrigue of Stuxnet, emphasizing how it was a highly sophisticated, targeted cyber weapon.
-	The ending or wrap up of the presentation could have been a little better. Maybe explaining how it changed cyber warfare or defense strategies in a way that would leave a lasting impact.

Alexia & Kaitlyn
-	Dude, where’s my heap
-	Good job explaining complex memory-related bug in an engaging way.
-	One suggestion is to simplify the visual aids of the heap before and after the bug is triggered.
