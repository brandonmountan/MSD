Hz
	how many times something happens in 1 second
	unit of frequency
	1 Hz = 1 cycle per second
	
Kilo-, Mega-, Giga-, Tera- (byte, Hz, etc)
	1000, 1 million, 1 billion, 1 trillion

elf (in terms of Unix programs)
	special "recipe" file that tells your computer how to run a program
	file format that Unix programs use for executables, object code, and shared libraries

Thrashing
	when a computer is too busy swapping things in/out of memory, slowing performance
	hamster running too fast on a wheel
	
Virtual
	something that does not physically exist but is represented in a way to make it appear real
	usually that something is memory, storage, or hardware
	Something that's not real but looks real
	
Memory
	hardware component in a computer that stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently for processing
	RAM (Random Access Memory) - temporary storage
	ROM (Read-Only Memory) - permanent storage
	
Address Space
	all the "rooms" a program can use in the computer's memory
	range of memory addresses program or process can use

Address
	a specific "room number" in memory
	unique identifier for a location in memory

Machine
	fancy word for the computer itself
	general term for computer or computing device

Time Sharing
	A system where multiple users or processes share a computer's resources by taking turns

Digital (Discrete) vs Analog
	Digital: data that is represented by discrete values (binary)
		counting with numbers, turn light on (1) or off (0)
	Analog: data represented in continuous signals (sound waves)
		smooth changes, like dimming a light

Kernel vs OS
	Kernel: core pare of an OS, managing hardware and system resources
		the boss
	OS (Operating System): FULL software that include the kernel and other tools for managing the computer
		the whole team

Von Neumann
	Von Neumann Architecture: Computer design where programs and data share the same memory
		Instructions and data live in the same place

Integrated Circuit (IC)
	Tiny chip containing tiny electronic components like transistors that help the computer "think"

State Machine (FSA - Finite State Automaton)
	Model that represents a system with a finite number of states and transitions between them
	A pretend robot that can only be in one "mood" at at time and changes based on what you tell it to do

Hardware (or program) privilege level
	Security feature that restricts access to certain system resources based on levels of privilege
	Security guard

Context Switch
	When a CPU switches from one task or process to another, saving and restoring states

Lazy loading (of program, of memory, etc)
	Delaying the loading of data or code until it's actually needed
	waiting to do something until you really need it

PID - Process ID
	unique number assigned to a running process in an operating system
	"name tag"

DMA - direct memory access
	feature that allows hardware to access memory directly, bypassing the CPU
	shortcut that lets parts of the computer talk to each other without bothering the boss

MMU (Memory Management Unit)/ TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)
	MMU: hardware that handles memory access and translation
		helper that keeps track of where things are stored in the computer's memory
	TLB: A cache used by the MMU to speed up virtual-to-physical address translation
		Super-fast cheat sheet the MMU uses to remember where things are
Daemon
	Background process in Unix-like systems that handles tasks without user interaction

Symbol (with respect to Code, object files, assembly)
	A reference to a function, variable, object in code, often used in linking and debugging
	A name for something in a program

Shared Library
	Collection of code and data that multiple programs can use simultaneously, reducing redundancy
