# Homework 4: The various classifers
## Due Friday, June, 20th.

##Step 1: Choose a Dataset

* Select a dataset from:
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)


The dataset must meet the following criteria:

* Must be a classification problem (the target variable has discrete labels)

* Have at least 500 samples

* Have at least 4 features (excluding the label)

* Picking a new database that we have not used already (e.g., the titanic dataset)

## Step 2: Preprocess the Data

* Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing:

* Handle missing values (drop or impute)

* Convert categorical features to numeric (e.g., one-hot encoding)


* Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split)

* Clearly explain any choices you make.

## Step 3: Train the Models

* Using scikit-learn or statsmodels:

* Train the four models listed above



## Step 4: Evaluate and Compare

For each model:

* Report accuracy, and other stats

* Visualize the confusion matrix

* If applicable, explain how the model makes decisions (e.g., feature importance in decision trees, coefficients in logistic regression)

## Step 5: Reflect

In a short paragraph, answer the following:

* Which model performed best overall and why?

* Which model was easiest/hardest to interpret?

* Which model do you think would scale well with more data?

* What challenges did you face while working with the dataset?

## Submission Instructions

* Push your work to your Github repo.

* Include a short report (1â€“2 pages) summarizing your findings.
